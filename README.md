# Usage

To insert a header, simply use `CMD` + `Alt` + `H` on macOS, or `Ctrl` + `Alt` + `H` on Linux / Windows.

If a header is already present, it will update filename and last update user and date.


# Configuration

If you wanna use this extension on your own computer, you'll maybe need to configure the username and email address you wanna display in the headers.

To do this, simply edit you *User Preferences*, and edit or insert these keys :

`42header.username`

`42header.email`
